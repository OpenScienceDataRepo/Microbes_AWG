# Microbes Analysis Working Group (AWG)

**OSDR AWGs Overview**  
The [Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/) is a science collaboration initiative that provides an open-access data system designed to help scientists discover and access space-relevant datasets to perform primary, secondary, and meta-analyses. OSDR has established the [Analysis Working Groups (AWGs)](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/awg/about.html) with the goal of optimizing the metadata, data, and features available to maximize the gain of new knowledge from such rare and complex datasets. The AWGs will assess and improve the effectiveness of the OSDR through intensive utilization of OSDR resources and generate higher-order data. This GitHub repository is dedicated for Microbes AWG members to share and collaborate their work and codes.

**Microbes AWG Overview**  
The Microbes Analysis Working group is comprised of researchers focused on analyzing microbial datasets within GeneLab that includes gene-expression, proteomic, metabolomic and environmental metagenomic datasets. The group aims to establish a standard pipelines for 16S amplicon metagneome profiling datasets that will allow the public to better understand these datasets and allow more rapid reanalysis and publication. The group has also contributed to identifiy different microbiome profiling assays that could be used in combination to gain a more complete understanding of the microbial contents of the mouse gut and how this changes during spaceflight. Microbes AWG members meet regularly to share and discuss the latest developments in microbial communities.
